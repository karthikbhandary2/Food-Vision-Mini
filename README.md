# Food-Vision-Mini
This repository consists the projects foodvision_mini which I did as a part of PyTorch for deep learning course by ZTM. 

The model used in this project is `EfficientNetV2` which was taken from the pytroch models through `transfer learning`. The dataset used for this project is from `Food101`. I only used a subset of the dataset which include `pizza`, `sushi` and `steak` dataset.

The project is deployed in `Hugging Face ðŸ¤—` using `Gradio`
